GIT Notes:

//git reset <file>                  = Unstage a particular file
//git reset --soft HEAD^            = Undo last commit, put files back onto staging
//git commit --amend -m "Message"   = change/add to the previous commit
//git reset --hard HEAD^            = Undo last commit and all changes
//git checkout -- <file>            = Discard changes

DIFF:
//git diff HEAD <file>

//git remote add origin https://github.com/jgeringer/git-real.git
//git push -u origin master         = origin: remote repository name, master: local branch to push

Having Muliple Remotes:
//github is our cannonical repo = origin

To add a new remote:
//git remote add <name> <address>
    Try remoting to my live site

To remove Remotes
git remote rm <name>

To push to Remotes:
git push -u <name> <branch>         = -u means that it'll remember it so next time you can just do "git push", <branch> = usually is master
