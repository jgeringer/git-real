            //global Imports: for clearer, faster globals in modules, use imports.

            var wartime = true;

            var ARMORY = (function(war){ //global import (war): first step is to create a parameter. can create as many prams as there are globals that you will be importing.

                //so essentially: war gets closed up inside the ARMORY namespace as a local variable.

                return{
                    makeWeapon: function(){
                        //if(wartime){ //looks at a global variable. this is expesnive, since it looks all the way up the chain to the global namespace. not great.
                        if(war){ //now replaced global 'wartime' with war.
                            //let civilians have weapons...
                        }
                    }
                }

            })(wartime); //this is where the magic happens. you can pass all the globals into the IIFE using the calling parenthesis. imported!
